#Monk Micro

This is a Script to assist with Monk Micro is Age of Empires 2
Not intended for use in competetive play, as it gives an unfair advantage.


You will need three things in order for this to work:

1. AutoHotKey (AHK) will need to be installed
2. You will need the (X,Y) coordinates of the Monk icon when you have multiple monks selected, specifically, the left most monk icon
3. You will need to decide what hotkeys to use

By default, two keys need to be pressed at once. Those keys are "A" and "D". 
Simply change the "hotKey1" and "hotKey2" variables in the MonkMicro.ahk file if you want to customize those.

To get the coordinates of the monk Icon, you can use the "MouseGetPos" function in AutoHotKey, or just plug and test over and over

##Running the Script

You will need to run the script before your game starts. If not, your hotkeys will not work.
